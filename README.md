## Social Media API @TDP Monthly (June 2019)


### Utilize Social Media API to Target Your Audience

How does data science incorporate with marketing strategy? How to personalize advertisement for your customer on social media? This talk will cover Facebook Marketing API and Facebook Ads Manager. The documentation and the infrastructure of FB API are thorough and easy to explore. By interacting with FB API, we can get the audience size of our products or services, and therefore, understand the audience better to personalize the advertisement. The ads platform, Facebook Ads Manager, also provides insights from their user data. Moreover, I will also share other API I am working on, including the way to get the data and potential usage for media strategy. 

In sum, social media API helps our company to successfully understand and target the audience. However, it might also raise the concern of data privacy. We need to be careful and conscious about the way we use data.
